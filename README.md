 Task 05: Traffic Accident Data Analysis
# 🚦 Task 05: Traffic Accident Data Analysis

As part of my Data Science Internship at **Prodigy InfoTech**, I analyzed a traffic accident dataset to uncover patterns related to:

- 🕒 Time of day
- 📅 Day of week
- 🌦️ Weather conditions
- 💡 Lighting conditions

## 📊 Dataset Used

- Source: [Kaggle - Traffic Accidents Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oktayrdeki/traffic-accidents)
- ~45,000 real-world traffic accident records

## 🧹 Steps Performed

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Removed nulls and unnecessary columns  
   - Converted `crash_date` into datetime  
2. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Extracted hour & weekday from crash timestamps  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Plots by time, day, weather, lighting  
4. **Insights Extraction**  
   - Discovered accident trends during rush hours, bad weather, etc.
